# Tasks: Apple iCloud Integration via App-Specific Password

> **⚠️ Scope Revision (2026-03-09)**: Apple Reminders was removed from the web app.  
> Tasks referencing `apple-reminders/index.ts` (T007, T011, T023, T029, T032, T039) are **superseded** — the adapter file was deleted.  
> Tasks T010, T015, T016, T018, T035, T036 were revised to reflect the single-Apple-service model.  
> See `spec.md` Scope Revision section for full details.

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-apple-basic-auth/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/api.md ✅, quickstart.md ✅

**Tests**: Included — plan.md Constitution Principle IV marks tests as ⚠️ REQUIRED before merge.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no unresolved dependencies within the current phase)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Exact file paths are included in every task description

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: Establish a clean baseline before changing any source files.

- [X] T001 Confirm branch `004-apple-basic-auth` is active and run `pnpm test` in `backend/` to record the baseline test count (expected: 71 passing, 0 failing)

**Checkpoint**: Baseline passing — proceed to foundational changes

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Type system and schema changes that ALL user stories depend on. Must be fully complete before any US phase begins.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete — every adapter, service, and route file imports from these two sources.

- [X] T002 Add `calendarEventWindowDays Int @default(30)` field to the `Integration` model in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (after `gmailSyncMode`, before `importEverything`; see data-model.md for exact placement)
- [X] T003 Run Prisma migration and regenerate the client in `backend/`: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-calendar-event-window && npx prisma generate` (depends on T002)
- [X] T004 Update `backend/src/integrations/_adapter/types.ts`: add `OAuthPayload`, `CredentialPayload`, `ConnectPayload` union types; add `ConnectOptions.calendarEventWindowDays?: 7 | 14 | 30 | 60`; change `IntegrationAdapter.connect()` signature to `connect(userId: string, payload: ConnectPayload, options?: ConnectOptions)`; add `NotSupportedError`, `InvalidCredentialsError`, and `ProviderUnavailableError` error classes (see data-model.md for exact TypeScript definitions; depends on T003)
- [X] T005 [P] Migrate `GmailAdapter.connect()` in `backend/src/integrations/gmail/index.ts` to the new `ConnectPayload` signature: change parameter from `(userId, authCode)` to `(userId, payload: ConnectPayload)`, narrow on `payload.type === 'oauth'`, and destructure `const { authCode } = payload` — no logic changes inside the method (depends on T004)
- [X] T006 [P] Migrate `MicrosoftTasksAdapter.connect()` in `backend/src/integrations/microsoft-tasks/index.ts` to the new `ConnectPayload` signature using the same mechanical pattern as T005 — narrow on `payload.type === 'oauth'`, destructure `authCode`, no logic changes (depends on T004)

**Checkpoint**: TypeScript compiles clean with the new interface; Prisma client reflects `calendarEventWindowDays`; Gmail and Microsoft adapters pass their existing tests unmodified — user story implementation can begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Connect Apple Services (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Users can connect Apple Calendar using an iCloud email + App-Specific Password credential form.  
*(Originally: "Connect Apple Reminders or Apple Calendar … one-click confirmation screen for second Apple service" — Apple Reminders removed 2026-03-09)*

**Independent Test**: Navigate to integration settings, click "Connect" on Apple Calendar, enter valid iCloud credentials, verify the integration shows "connected" and Calendar data is available.

### Tests for User Story 1 ⚠️ Write these first — they must FAIL before T011–T018

- ~~[X] T007 [P] [US1] *(Superseded — Apple Reminders removed)* Add Apple Reminders adapter connect() unit tests to `backend/tests/unit/apple-reminders.sync.test.ts`~~ *(file deleted per Scope Revision)*
- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Add Apple Calendar adapter connect() unit tests to `backend/tests/unit/apple-calendar.sync.test.ts` covering the same six scenarios as T007, plus: `connect()` with `calendarEventWindowDays: 14` stores `14` on the Integration record; `connect()` with no `calendarEventWindowDays` defaults to `30`
- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Create `backend/tests/unit/integration.service.test.ts`: `connectIntegration()` with `{ type: 'credential', email, password }` normalizes ASP (strips dashes) before calling adapter; `connectIntegration()` with `{ type: 'use-existing' }` and a connected sibling copies decrypted credentials to adapter call; `connectIntegration()` with `{ type: 'use-existing' }` and no connected sibling throws `NO_EXISTING_CREDENTIALS`; `listIntegrations()` returns `maskedEmail: 'j***@icloud.com'` for Apple service with credentials on file; `listIntegrations()` returns `maskedEmail: null` for Apple service with no credentials; `listIntegrations()` returns `calendarEventWindowDays: 30` for connected `apple_calendar`
- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Create `backend/tests/contract/integration-connect.routes.test.ts`: `POST /api/integrations/apple_calendar/connect` with valid credential body → 200 `{ integrationId, status: 'connected' }`; with invalid credentials (mocked 401) → 401 `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`; for `serviceId: 'gmail'` → 400 `UNSUPPORTED_SERVICE`; with provider unavailable (mocked 503) → 503 `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` *(Revised — apple_reminders routes removed)*

### Implementation for User Story 1

- ~~[X] T011 [P] [US1] *(Superseded — Apple Reminders removed)* Rewrite `AppleRemindersAdapter` in `backend/src/integrations/apple-reminders/index.ts`~~ *(file deleted per Scope Revision)*
- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Rewrite `AppleCalendarAdapter` in `backend/src/integrations/apple-calendar/index.ts` using the identical pattern as T011, additionally storing `options?.calendarEventWindowDays ?? 30` into `calendarEventWindowDays` on upsert
- [X] T013 [US1] Update `connectIntegration()` and `listIntegrations()` in `backend/src/integrations/integration.service.ts`: in `connectIntegration()` handle `{ type: 'use-existing' }` by looking up the sibling Apple service Integration for the user (throws `AppError('NO_EXISTING_CREDENTIALS', ...)` if not found), decrypt its credentials, and forward as `CredentialPayload`; normalize ASP via `password.replace(/-/g, '')` for `{ type: 'credential' }` payloads before calling adapter; in `listIntegrations()` add `maskEmail()` helper and populate `maskedEmail` (non-null only for Apple services with non-empty `encryptedAccessToken`) and `calendarEventWindowDays` (non-null only for `apple_calendar` when status is not `disconnected`) on every `IntegrationStatusItem` (depends on T011, T012)
- [X] T014 [US1] Add `POST /api/integrations/:serviceId/connect` route to `backend/src/api/integrations.routes.ts`: Zod discriminated-union body schema (`type: 'credential'` with `email`, `password`, optional `calendarEventWindowDays`; `type: 'use-existing'`); guard rejects non-Apple `serviceId` with 400 `UNSUPPORTED_SERVICE`; map `InvalidCredentialsError` → 401, `ProviderUnavailableError` → 503, `AppError('NO_EXISTING_CREDENTIALS')` → 409 (depends on T013)
- [X] T015 [P] [US1] Create `frontend/src/components/AppleCredentialForm.tsx`: props `{ serviceId: 'apple_calendar'; onSuccess(): void; onError(msg: string): void }` *(Revised — apple_reminders removed from prop type)*; `<input type="email">` for iCloud email; `<input type="password">` for ASP; callout block: "An App-Specific Password lets ordrctrl access your iCloud data without sharing your Apple ID password. [Generate one at appleid.apple.com ↗]" (external link); on submit call `connectWithCredentials(serviceId, email, password)`; display inline error without page reload on error response
- [X] T016 [P] [US1] Create `frontend/src/components/AppleConfirmationScreen.tsx`: props `{ serviceId: 'apple_calendar'; maskedEmail: string; onSuccess(): void; onError(msg: string): void }` *(Revised — apple_reminders removed; component retained but dormant in web app)*; render "Connect {service label} using your iCloud account **{maskedEmail}**?"; single "Connect with this account" button; on click call `confirmWithExisting(serviceId)`
- [X] T017 [US1] Add `connectWithCredentials(serviceId, email, password, calendarEventWindowDays?)` and `confirmWithExisting(serviceId)` functions to `frontend/src/services/integrations.service.ts` — both `POST` to `/api/integrations/:serviceId/connect` with the respective body shape (depends on T014)
- [X] T018 [US1] Update the "Connect" action section of `frontend/src/components/IntegrationCard.tsx`: when `serviceId === 'apple_calendar'`, render `<AppleCredentialForm />`; leave OAuth connect link path unchanged for all non-Apple services *(Revised — `AppleConfirmationScreen` dormant; `APPLE_SERVICE_IDS.includes()` branch removed; depends on T015, T016, T017)*

**Checkpoint**: US1 is independently functional — Apple credential form and one-click confirmation connect flow work end-to-end; 71 + new US1 tests pass

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — Sync Apple Tasks and Events (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: After connecting, Apple Reminders sync fetches real tasks from iCloud via Basic Auth CalDAV. Apple Calendar sync fetches upcoming events within the user's configurable time window (7/14/30/60 days, default 30). Both adapters use the encrypted credentials stored in Phase 3.

**Independent Test**: Pre-seed a connected Integration record with valid encrypted credentials. Trigger a sync. Verify iCloud tasks/events appear in ordrctrl. Update the event window via the selector and re-sync; verify only events within the new window are returned.

### Tests for User Story 2 ⚠️ Write these first — they must FAIL before T023–T028

- ~~[X] T019 [P] [US2] *(Superseded — Apple Reminders removed)* Add Apple Reminders sync() unit tests to `backend/tests/unit/apple-reminders.sync.test.ts`~~ *(file deleted per Scope Revision)*
- [X] T020 [P] [US2] Add Apple Calendar sync() unit tests to `backend/tests/unit/apple-calendar.sync.test.ts`: `sync()` reads `integration.calendarEventWindowDays` and builds CalDAV time-range filter from `now` to `now + windowDays * 86400000 ms`; test with `calendarEventWindowDays: 7` produces a 7-day window; test with `calendarEventWindowDays: 60` produces a 60-day window; verify Basic Auth header construction identical to T019
- [X] T021 [P] [US2] Add `updateCalendarEventWindow()` tests to `backend/tests/unit/integration.service.test.ts`: valid `days` values (7, 14, 30, 60) update `calendarEventWindowDays` on the Integration record and return `{ calendarEventWindowDays: days }`; calling with no connected `apple_calendar` integration throws `AppError('INTEGRATION_NOT_FOUND')`
- [X] T022 [P] [US2] Create `backend/tests/contract/integration-event-window.routes.test.ts`: `PUT /api/integrations/apple_calendar/event-window` with `{ days: 14 }` → 200 `{ serviceId, calendarEventWindowDays: 14 }`; with `{ days: 999 }` → 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR`; with no connected `apple_calendar` → 404 `INTEGRATION_NOT_FOUND` *(Revised — apple_reminders UNSUPPORTED_SERVICE test removed)*

### Implementation for User Story 2

- ~~[X] T023 [P] [US2] *(Superseded — Apple Reminders removed)* Rewrite `AppleRemindersAdapter.sync()` in `backend/src/integrations/apple-reminders/index.ts`~~ *(file deleted per Scope Revision)*
- [X] T024 [P] [US2] Rewrite `AppleCalendarAdapter.sync()` in `backend/src/integrations/apple-calendar/index.ts` using the same Basic Auth header pattern as T023; replace the hardcoded `30`-day event window with `const windowDays = integration.calendarEventWindowDays ?? 30` and build CalDAV time-range as `start = now`, `end = new Date(now.getTime() + windowDays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)`
- [X] T025 [US2] Add `updateCalendarEventWindow(userId: string, days: 7 | 14 | 30 | 60)` to `backend/src/integrations/integration.service.ts`: find Integration where `userId`, `serviceId: 'apple_calendar'`, `status != 'disconnected'`; throw `AppError('INTEGRATION_NOT_FOUND', ...)` if not found; update `calendarEventWindowDays` and return `{ calendarEventWindowDays: updated.calendarEventWindowDays }`
- [X] T026 [US2] Add `PUT /api/integrations/:serviceId/event-window` route to `backend/src/api/integrations.routes.ts`: Zod body `{ days: z.union([z.literal(7), z.literal(14), z.literal(30), z.literal(60)]) }`; guard rejects non-`apple_calendar` serviceId with 400 `UNSUPPORTED_SERVICE`; map `AppError('INTEGRATION_NOT_FOUND')` → 404 (depends on T025)
- [X] T027 [P] [US2] Add `updateCalendarEventWindow(days: 7 | 14 | 30 | 60)` function to `frontend/src/services/integrations.service.ts` — `PUT /api/integrations/apple_calendar/event-window` with `{ days }` body; returns `{ calendarEventWindowDays: number }`
- [X] T028 [US2] Add event window selector to the Apple Calendar `IntegrationCard` section in `frontend/src/components/IntegrationCard.tsx`: render a `<select>` (or segmented control) with options 7, 14, 30, 60 days when `serviceId === 'apple_calendar'` and status is `'connected'`; on change call `updateCalendarEventWindow(days)` and refresh integration status; initialize value from `integration.calendarEventWindowDays` (depends on T027)

**Checkpoint**: US2 is independently functional — Apple Reminders and Calendar sync real iCloud data; event window is configurable and persists across sync cycles

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Reconnect After Credential Change (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: When a stored App-Specific Password is revoked, the next sync detects the 401 from iCloud, sets the integration to an error state with an explanatory message, and the frontend surfaces a reconnect prompt. Disconnecting the last Apple integration permanently purges all stored iCloud credentials.

**Independent Test**: Connect with valid credentials. Revoke the ASP externally (or mock a 401 response). Trigger a sync. Verify `integration.status === 'error'` with the "credentials no longer valid" message. Click "Reconnect", enter new valid credentials, verify status returns to `'connected'` and sync resumes.

### Tests for User Story 3 ⚠️ Write these first — they must FAIL before T032–T036

- ~~[X] T029 [P] [US3] *(Superseded — Apple Reminders removed)* Add sync() error-discrimination tests to `backend/tests/unit/apple-reminders.sync.test.ts`~~ *(file deleted per Scope Revision)*
- [X] T030 [P] [US3] Add sync() error-discrimination tests to `backend/tests/unit/apple-calendar.sync.test.ts` covering the same three scenarios as T029
- [X] T031 [P] [US3] Add disconnect cleanup tests to `backend/tests/unit/integration.service.test.ts`: `disconnectIntegration()` for `apple_calendar` sets status to `disconnected` and clears `encryptedAccessToken` and `encryptedRefreshToken` *(Revised — sibling cross-check test removed; credentials always purged)*

### Implementation for User Story 3

- ~~[X] T032 [P] [US3] *(Superseded — Apple Reminders removed)* Add 401/5xx guards to all CalDAV fetch calls inside `AppleRemindersAdapter.sync()` in `backend/src/integrations/apple-reminders/index.ts`~~ *(file deleted per Scope Revision)*
- [X] T033 [P] [US3] Add identical 401/5xx guards to all CalDAV fetch calls inside `AppleCalendarAdapter.sync()` in `backend/src/integrations/apple-calendar/index.ts` using the same pattern as T032
- [X] T034 [US3] Update the sync job error handler in `backend/src/integrations/integration.service.ts` to catch `InvalidCredentialsError` → `prisma.integration.update({ status: 'error', lastSyncError: 'iCloud credentials are no longer valid. Please reconnect.' })` and catch `ProviderUnavailableError` → `prisma.integration.update({ status: 'error', lastSyncError: 'iCloud is temporarily unavailable. Will retry on next sync.' })` with credentials explicitly retained (no field clear) (depends on T032, T033)
- [X] T035 [US3] Simplify Apple disconnect cleanup in `disconnectIntegration()` in `backend/src/integrations/integration.service.ts`: after disconnecting `apple_calendar`, always purge `encryptedAccessToken` and `encryptedRefreshToken` *(Revised — cross-check logic simplified since only one Apple service remains; depends on T034)*
- [X] T036 [US3] Add reconnect prompt to `frontend/src/components/IntegrationCard.tsx`: when `integration.status === 'error'` and `serviceId === 'apple_calendar'`, display `integration.lastSyncError` message and a "Reconnect" button that opens `<AppleCredentialForm />` in the card; preserve existing error display behavior for non-Apple services *(Revised — apple_reminders check removed)*

**Checkpoint**: US3 is independently functional — credential expiry is detected, surfaced, and recovery via reconnect works; all three user stories are complete and independently testable

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Regression safety, code hygiene, and environment cleanup touching multiple user stories.

- [X] T037 [P] Update `backend/tests/unit/gmail.sync.test.ts`: change any `adapter.connect(userId, authCode)` call to `adapter.connect(userId, { type: 'oauth', authCode })` and confirm all Gmail tests still pass
- [X] T038 [P] Update `backend/tests/unit/microsoft-tasks.sync.test.ts`: apply the same `{ type: 'oauth', authCode }` wrapper update as T037 and confirm all Microsoft Tasks tests still pass
- ~~[X] T039 [P] *(Superseded — Apple Reminders removed)* Remove all `TODO(spec-004)` comments from `backend/src/integrations/apple-reminders/index.ts`~~ *(file deleted per Scope Revision)*
- [X] T040 [P] Remove all `TODO(spec-004)` comments from `backend/src/integrations/apple-calendar/index.ts`
- [X] T041 Update `backend/.env.example`: remove stale Apple OAuth vars (`APPLE_REMINDERS_CLIENT_ID`, `APPLE_REMINDERS_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_REMINDERS_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_REMINDERS_PRIVATE_KEY`, `APPLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID`, `APPLE_CALENDAR_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_CALENDAR_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_CALENDAR_PRIVATE_KEY`); add commented placeholder block `# Apple iCloud (dev/test only) — APPLE_USERNAME= APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=`
- [X] T042 Run the full backend test suite (`pnpm test` in `backend/`) and confirm all 71 original tests plus all new US1/US2/US3 tests pass with zero failures; fix any unexpected regressions before marking this phase complete

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
  └─► Phase 2 (Foundational) — BLOCKS all user stories
        ├─► Phase 3 (US1) ──────────────────────────────┐
        ├─► Phase 4 (US2) ──────────────────────────────┤─► Phase 6 (Polish)
        └─► Phase 5 (US3) ──────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies — start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 — BLOCKS all user stories; T005 and T006 are parallel once T004 completes
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: All depend on Phase 2 completion; T007–T010 tests are parallel with each other; T011–T012 are parallel with each other; T013 depends on T011+T012; T014 depends on T013; T015–T016 are parallel with each other and with T014; T017 depends on T014; T018 depends on T015+T016+T017
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Phase 2; T019–T022 tests are parallel; T023–T024 are parallel; T025 is independent; T026 depends on T025; T027 is independent; T028 depends on T027
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Phase 3 (uses same adapter files and service layer); T029–T031 tests are parallel; T032–T033 are parallel; T034 depends on T032+T033; T035 depends on T034; T036 is independent of T034+T035
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories complete; T037–T040 are parallel with each other; T041 is independent; T042 is the final gate

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: No dependency on US2 or US3 — can be fully delivered and tested as MVP
- **US2 (P1)**: No dependency on US1 (sync is independent of connect flow) — independently testable via pre-seeded Integration record
- **US3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (reuses adapter files modified in Phase 3) and US2 (error handling in sync covers both adapters); can be started after US1 is complete

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 — both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T002–T006) — CRITICAL gate
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 (T007–T018) — credential connect flow
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Users can connect Apple services end-to-end
5. Complete Phase 4: US2 (T019–T028) — sync actually works
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Connected Apple services sync real iCloud data
7. Deploy MVP — both P1 stories delivered

### Full Delivery (adds US3 + polish)

8. Complete Phase 5: US3 (T029–T036) — reconnect after credential change
9. Complete Phase 6: Polish (T037–T042) — regression safety + cleanup
10. Full merge ready

### Parallel Team Strategy (2+ developers)

After Phase 2 is complete:
- **Developer A**: Phase 3 US1 (T007–T018) — connect flow
- **Developer B**: Phase 4 US2 (T019–T028) — sync rewrite (uses same adapter files; coordinate on apple-reminders/index.ts and apple-calendar/index.ts to avoid merge conflicts — suggest Developer A finishes T011/T012 before Developer B starts T023/T024)

---

## Notes

- `[P]` tasks operate on different files with no unresolved dependencies — safe to run concurrently within the same phase
- `[US1]`, `[US2]`, `[US3]` labels map tasks to spec.md user stories for traceability
- `backend/src/integrations/apple-reminders/index.ts` and `backend/src/integrations/apple-calendar/index.ts` are touched in US1 (T011/T012), US2 (T023/T024), and US3 (T032/T033) — if working these stories in parallel, coordinate on these files to avoid merge conflicts
- Tests must be written and confirmed FAILING before their corresponding implementation tasks are started
- Commit after each task or logical group; validate story checkpoints before proceeding
- ASP normalization (`password.replace(/-/g, '')`) happens in the service layer (T013), not in the adapter — adapters always receive an already-normalized 16-character string
- `tokenExpiresAt` is always stored as `null` for Apple Integration records — credentials are revoked, not expired

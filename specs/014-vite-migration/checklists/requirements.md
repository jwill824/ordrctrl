# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate Frontend to Vite SPA

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is a pure infrastructure migration spec — all user stories frame success as "nothing visible changes" for existing users, which is the correct framing for a refactor
- Stories 3 and 4 (mobile/desktop build targets) frame the strategic value of the migration without leaking implementation details
- Dependencies section explicitly unlocks specs 015 and 016
